It is the night after a joyous first birthday celebration for Minna, the only lamb in the village of Schafstadt am Berg. Ewald, the mayor of the village, lies in a deep sleep
EWALD: Zzz... Zzz... Zzz
a rattling wind blows outside, the sound of cornstalks brushing together, wheat shifting in the wind, and underneath it all... the sound of wolves howling
EWALD: Zzz... Zzz... AH! 
Ewald jerks awake, as if from a nightmare. Rubs his eyes. The wind still blows.
EWALD: Ugh... too much to drink. Maybe I should get some fresh air.
-> Get up
    Ewald yawns, rubs sleep from his eyes. Gets out of bed.

Ewald approaches the door
As he moves to push it open, something outsides snarls. 
The smell of rotten corn is overpowering. 
He freezes in his tracks.
Ewald: Magdalene?

Ewald walks to the window and opens it. A gust of cold, cold air blows in, the smell of pine from the forest mixed with an undertone of moldering corn. 
The howls grow louder. Ewald shakes his head, mutters: 
EWALD: Early for wolves. I'll have to tell Helmut to mind harvesting alone.
Ewald takes a breath of night air, shivers.
A chuckle drifts on the wind, like dry kernels rattled in a cup.
-> Who's there? 
    The wind dies. All is quiet
    EWALD: Magdalene, if you're having a joke again, it's damn late.
    [[Go outside to investigate |Door]]
-> Shut the window
    Ewald closes the window, shakes his head. Goes back to bed.
    The howls grow louder.
    There is a faint knock at the door
    [[ Ignore it: |Ignore_knock]]

The doorway is filled with a figure twice Ewald's height, wearing nothing but a skirt of corn husks
Its skin is peppered with hardened corn kernels, tufts of corn silk where hair should be.
Atop its head a crown of corn cobs, knawed to the core and rotting.
It steps into the house.

Ewald pretends he hasn't heard anything. It might just be the wind.
The knock grows louder.

-> Ignore it 
    Ewald puts the pillow over his head
    The wind picks up. 
    The smell of rotting corn gets stronger.
    The knocking gets louder.

The figure looms over Ewald. The smell is overpowering.
CORN KING: Cat got your tongue, little sheep?
The figure laughs
CORN KING: No matter, where is the lamb?
Ewald gathers himself

The figure emits a laugh like kernels popping in the kettle
CORN KING: Oh, little sheep. I like you. If you were a smidge younger...
CORN KING: ...I could just eat you up.
The figure leers at Ewald
CORN KING: But, alas. Too late. no matter. Where is the lamb?

CORN KING: Why does anybody do anything, little sheep.
CORN KING: Because we're hungry.
Two wolves, eyes glowing red, enter the house behind the figure.

A loud growl sounds behind the Oat King.
Two wolves, eyes glowing red, stalk into the house.
