Dusk approaches. A chill is rising in the air, the Feldgeister rousing. 
//Franziska arrives as the sun sets, bearing the traps and defenses she has made during the day.
//You have only a brief time to make sure everyone is fed, defended, and most importantly....
//You've running out of daylight to decide where Minna will be safest
//EWALD: May we make it through the night.
//-> It's time to choose.
